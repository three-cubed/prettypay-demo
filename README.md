This basic directory exists to demonstrate Prettypay, a payment processor simulation for developers. In line with this purpose, the parent directory is intentionally simple and underdeveloped.

Prettypay is a payment processor simulation for developers. Prettypay is added as a separate directory within the overall directory.

**For more information about prettypay and how to use it, read `README.md` in the Prettypay directory itself.**

You are free to use Prettypay non-commercially. For further information, please see `LICENCE.md` in the Prettypay directory.
