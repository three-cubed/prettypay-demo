## The programme

This basic programme directory exists to demonstrate Prettypay, a payment processor simulation for developers. In line with this purpose, the parent directory is intentionally simplistic and underdeveloped.

Prettypay version 1 was added as a separate directory within the overall directory. Since Prettypay version 2.0.0, Prettypay is now a node package. To add it to a directory, use:<br>`npm install prettypay`

**For more information about prettypay and how to use it, go to `https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettypay`.**

You are free to use Prettypay non-commercially. For further information, please see `LICENCE.md` in the Prettypay directory.

## Automated browser tests

The programming for this website has automated browser tests using jest and puppeteer.

To run the tests on this website, you must run `npm start` to start up the programme, and then (in another terminal) run `npm test`.
