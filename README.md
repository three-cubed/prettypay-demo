This basic directory exists to demonstrate Prettypay, a payment processor simulation for developers.

Prettypay is a payment processor simulation for developers. Prettypay is added as a separate directory within the overall directory.

Note that the `.env file` is *intentionally* included in the git repository, as this programme is a simulation and the information is not actually secret!

**For more information about prettypay and how to use it, read `README.md` in the Prettypay directory itself.**

You are free to use Prettypay non-commercially. For further information, please see `LICENCE.md` in the Prettypay directory.
